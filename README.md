## Task 1: NFA to DFA Conversion

### File:
```
nfa_to_dfa.py
```

### Description:
Converts a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) with epsilon transitions into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) using the subset construction algorithm.

### How to Run:
```bash
python task1
```

### Expected Output:
- List of DFA states
- Start and final states
- Transition table in readable format

##  Task 3: Unary Addition Turing Machine

### File:
```
unary_turing_machine.py
```

### Description:
Simulates a Turing Machine that computes the sum of two unary numbers (represented by `1`s) separated by a `+`.

### How to Run:
```bash
python task3
```

### Expected Output:
- Input: `111+11`
- Output: `11111`
